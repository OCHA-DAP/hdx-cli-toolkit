    "notes": "The IRC responds to emergencies (drought, floods, disease outbreaks, and conflict displacement) through its dedicated Emergency Rapid Response (ERR) Unit, which was established in 2005. Through two IRC-led multi-sector emergency response mechanisms\u2014the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) funded by USAID and the Emergency Response Mechanism (ERM) funded by ECHO\u2014 the ERR unit executes coordinated, rapid, and effective responses to emergencies through out Ethiopia immediately as they occur, either directly or through sub-awards other agencies.\r\n\r\nIRC\u2019s GIS unit created this database to allow for a more sustained approach to producing relevant mapping products and geospatial analysis for regions undergoing emergencies, and will fill gaps in information sharing and management between IRC; Donors (OFDA/USAID, ECHO, & others); and implementing partners during emergency response. IRC\u2019s GIS services provide information and analysis required to monitor the evolution of project / program results and to track project and program impacts across implementing agencies and geographic locations. This dataset contains boundaries of Ethiopian administrative Woredas which are roughly consistent with the actual administrative boundaries for the year 2021.The Woreda boundary contains attribute data (implementing Partners, Situation and Sector Fields) for IRC Ethiopia OFDA Funded Emergency Responses as of 31 August 2021.",
